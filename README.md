Guess the hidden word randomly generated from a list of words. Use the terminal to input your guess (press TAB to access the terminal, write your word, then press ENTER). The word must be an isogram (no repeating letters). If you guess a number of letters in the correct position of the word, a bull count is reported to the output. If you guess a number of letters in the wrong position of the word, a cow count is reported to the output.
